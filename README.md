# Madhav_store_powerbi_dashboard
This repository contains a Power BI dashboard project titled "Madhav E-commerce Sales Dashboard", which provides a comprehensive analysis of sales, profit, customer behavior, and product performance for an online retail business. The dashboard includes interactive visuals such as bar charts, pie charts, and time-series graphs that display key metrics like total sales amount (₹438K), total profit (₹37K), total quantity sold (5615), and average order value (₹120.9K). It highlights top-performing states (Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh), top customers, and profitable sub-categories like printers and bookcases. It also breaks down product categories by quantity sold (e.g., clothing dominates with 62.62%) and shows payment mode preferences, with Cash on Delivery (COD) being the most common. Additionally, a profit-loss monthly trend chart helps identify periods of high and low performance throughout the year. The dashboard is fully interactive with filters for quarters and categories, making it a powerful tool for business insights and decision-making.
